To run dockerized magento instance just type:
docker-compose up -d
If you want to install magento2:
chmod +x install-test-magento-environment.sh && ./install-test-magento-environment.sh sitename
where sitename is your website name
You can run script without parameter, so sitename will be default: http://testmagento.org

Don't forget to add ip-address and sitename to your hosts file 
win - c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
lin\macos - \etc\hosts

This command runs docker-compose, which runs docker containers:
Web container:
   nginx 1.10
   php7.0-fpm

DB container:
   mysql 5.6

MySQL credentials:
hostname: db
db name: magento
db user: root
db password: root

Website administration:
Backend url: http://<sitename>/admin
User: admin
Password: admin123!

After first start project folder will be created, so you need to put configuration files there.
Default configs are in the default-configs folder (nginx and varnish). Edit them as you like.
Control scripts (start, stop, restart, terminate) are in the control folder.
